# credit_default

A neural network classification model using TensorFlow is constructed to model and predict client credit card defaults, and is deployed on Google Cloud ML Engine. Data preprocessing is done with Apache Beam and data pipelines are created with DataFlow. Online prediction is then carried out with a REST API call to the model with desired input variables.
